- [ ] **Task 2:** Create serializers for Todo and Idea models.
- [ ] **Task 3:** Implement permissions to ensure that users can only modify todos and ideas related to their projects.
- [ ] **Task 4:** Write unit tests for todo and idea management API endpoints.

## Version 1.0

### Milestone 4: Randomizer Functionality
- [ ] **Task 1:** Design and implement a randomizer algorithm to suggest the next project to work on.
- [ ] **Task 2:** Create an API endpoint to trigger the randomizer and get project suggestions.
- [ ] **Task 3:** Integrate the randomizer with the frontend.

## Version 1.1.0

### Milestone 5: Language and Tag Selection
- [ ] **Task 1:** Extend Project model to include programming languages and tags.
- [ ] **Task 2:** Update API endpoints to filter projects based on selected programming languages and tags.
